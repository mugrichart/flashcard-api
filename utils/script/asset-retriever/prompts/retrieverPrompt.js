const retriever = (memoryGraph, structure, currentEp, currentAct, currentScenes, previousScene, currentScene) => `
 You are given a skeleton of the story being created. The current memory graph from which you extract the paths of the critical resources, and the previous scene if it exists (just to inform you of the latest)

    Context:
    - story theme: ${structure.theme}
    - episodes: ${structure.episodes.map(ep => ep.logline)}
    - current episode: ${currentEp}
    - current act log line: ${currentAct}
    - current act scenes: ${currentScenes}
    
    current memory path:
        ${JSON.stringify(memoryGraph)}

    Your job at this stage is to just point out the fields that are essential and need to be retrieved for the correct creation of this scene
    e.g: entities/people/a certain person


    The previous scene (to keep you grounded):
        ${JSON.stringify(previousScene)}

    The scene to be developed:
        ${currentScene}

    The information to be retrieved is criticcal to the development of this scene.
    And your job is to just provide the path to that resource and the retrieval will be done later using this path.

    typical json output:
    
    {
        "Kathy": "people",
        "Emily": "people",
        "studio": "places",
    }

You are given the current memory path, and your task is to point to the entity that is critical to the creation of this scene.
