For each of the input words, provide a sentence containing the word, and the same sentence with the word blanked out.

1. sentence and blanked go hand in hand. Don't forget either.
2. Every sentence should contain at least one of the words given to you

const fullScriptPrompt = (title, summary, words, players) => `
I am creating an English learning platform, and this particular feature consists of vocabulary mastering using role playing,
and your task is to generate a fun and simple script (no unnecessarily complicated words) to keep the learners engaged and excited to master the vocabulary

So:
1. Using this list of words (${words}), create a script that contains one word in a line, and it's the players' job to use these words inside.
2.  title:  ${title || "Generate a title for the story of the script"}
    summary: ${summary || "Generate a summary for the story of the script"}
    -> Use both this title and the summary to guide you in the script generation
3. Each item of the script should indicate whether it's actor line or a scene cue or indication given by a narrator (which means this won't be spoken by an actor)
4.  Use these player names. Players may sometimes reference each other, so use these names (once in a while you can be cheezy and nickname them using their actual names).
    Key actors: ${players.filter(player => player.isMain).map(player => player.name.toLowerCase())}
    Supporting characters: ${players.filter(player => !player.isMain).map(player => player.name.toLowerCase())}
    -> Only key players will have lines that contain the words (because is practice is basically tailored towards them since their are learning. The rest are just supporting).
5.  Since this is for the students to practice, the words they are practicing should be not be used anywhere (title, summary).
    When it comes to the script, for each line that contains one of the words, provide a rephrased fied, where the line is rephrased around the area where the word is used
    The words: ${words}
    -> No line can use more than one of the words!
6. The output is strictly json

7. Typical output:
{
    title: The title of the story,
    summary: a summary of the story,
    words: random, potential, misery
    details: [
